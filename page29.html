          The expected feedback so far, the Kurdisubtitle administration has not issued any official statement detailing the incident or the steps to be taken to address the situation. However, the administration is expected to: conduct a comprehensive security review of the site's technical system. Warn users of any electronic phishing or account exploitation attempts. Strengthening security systems and activating additional protection measures to avoid recurrence of such incidents. The importance of enhancing cybersecurity for websites This incident highlights the urgent need to enhance the electronic protection of popular sites. Recreational and cultural sites have become potential targets for cyber attacks that may disrupt services or leak data. The conclusion of the hacking operation that targeted KurdiSubtitle confirms that cyber threats have become more complex and widespread. Website management has to move quickly to secure its platform and protect its users from any potential attacks. The question remains: Will KurdiSubtitle succeed in tackling such future attacks?
