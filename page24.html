In a new hack that reflects the escalation of cyber attacks, the LazaGrad Hack team announced a large-scale attack targeting the Lovehabibi website, which operates illegally inside Iran. The attack resulted in the hacking of thousands of sensitive data of Iranian users and the disabling of many accounts on the platform, causing panic and concern about the security of personal information.

                <div class="news-summary">
  According to the information circulating, the LazaGrad Hack team was able to access a huge database containing sensitive information such as full names, email addresses, phone numbers, and possibly even private conversations and personal photos. Part of this data was leaked online as proof of the success of the operation, in a move aimed at exposing the weaknesses of the site’s security systems and sending a strong message against platforms operating outside the legal framework.

        <div class="news-summary">
Operation Details: Objective: A paid account of 5 million Iranian riyals. Target Platform: IranServer, one of the major web hosting platforms in Iran. The message: Supporting the Syrian brothers by weakening the digital infrastructure of the systems that support repression in the region.

Lovehabibi is a dating platform for people from different cultural and religious backgrounds, but it is officially banned in Iran due to the strict social and religious restrictions imposed on this type of site. However, the site continued to operate illegally, attracting a group of young Iranians looking for communication platforms away from government censorship. The LazaGrad Hack team behind this attack is known for its strong cyber activity and targeting platforms that the group considers illegal or contrary to moral values. The team has previously carried out several successful operations against sites and platforms in different countries, using advanced hacking methods aimed at disabling systems and exposing security vulnerabilities. This operation shows a high level of professionalism and careful planning, as it did not only hack data, but also included disabling user accounts and freezing site activities, which led to a partial shutdown of its services. This attack is believed to be part of an ongoing campaign by the LazaGrad Hack team targeting platforms that are seen as threatening societal values or operating outside local laws.
So far, Lovehabibi has not issued any official comment on the details of the hack or the steps it will take to address this crisis and secure users’ data. It is also not yet known what steps the Iranian authorities may take to confront these growing threats to cybersecurity. This hack once again highlights the seriousness of cyber attacks and their role in threatening digital privacy, especially in countries with strict restrictions on internet use. It also highlights the LazaGrad Hack team’s ability to carry out complex operations with high precision, making it one of the most prominent cyber teams currently active in this field.</div>
