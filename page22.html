  Within one day, the Lazagrad Group carried out cyber attacks on more than 32 sites in successive operations, including commercial, educational, and academic sites, as well as other sites related to hostile systems.

        <div class="news-summary">
 Among the hacked websites were many commercial platforms used by commercial companies to display their products, such as http://DeranFauzan.dx.am and http://lemoischer.onlinewebshop.net, as well as academic websites related to e-learning, such as http://Nahom.myartsonline.com and http://examsresult.onlinewebshop.net. The attacks were not limited to this only, but extended to include other sites and projects that were used by the enemies as tools to spread hostile political and media propaganda. The group confirmed in its statements that these attacks are part of its long-term strategy to destabilize the enemies' digital networks and enable the Mujahideen in Syria to confront the repressive regimes.

The campaign is part of the continuous support for Syria and the Syrian people in the face of the stalking forces, It is worth noting that the campaign was not limited to hacking these sites, but also included a comprehensive survey of enemies' digital infrastructure, with the aim of collecting vital information that could be used in the future. The group confirmed that it will continue in these attacks until its goals are achieved in supporting the Syrian revolution and achieving justice for the Syrian people.
